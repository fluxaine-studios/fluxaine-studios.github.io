You open it, you read, you move on with your life. That constraint wasn\u2019t accidental; it was survival. I\u2019ve learned the hard way that solo developers don\u2019t fail because they can\u2019t code\u2014they fail because scope quietly eats them alive.\\n\\nSo I drew a line early.\\n\\nNo backend.\\nNo user data.\\nNo social features.\\nNo \u201cmaybe later.\u201d\\n\\nJust a proverb, once a day.\\n\\n## Putting the Code Together\\n\\nFrom a technical standpoint, this was one of the most disciplined project I\u2019ve done.\\n\\nI used Expo with React Native and Expo Router, kept the architecture boring, and forced myself to ship functionality before polish. Local storage only. Notifications capped at one per day. Favorites persisted locally, with no illusions of sync or recovery.\\n\\nEven monetization was intentionally unambitious: non-blocking banner ads only. No interstitials. No \u201cwatch this to continue.\u201d If ads failed to load, the app still worked. The user\u2019s time mattered more than my hypothetical revenue.\\n\\nI tested edge cases manually: airplane mode, force-closes, denied permissions, dark mode quirks. I broke things, fixed them, and resisted the urge to refactor code that was already \u201cgood enough.\u201d\\n\\nAt some point, the app stopped feeling like a project and started feeling like a product. That\u2019s a subtle but important shift. When you open it and nothing surprises you anymore\u2014no crashes, no weird state, no awkward transitions\u2014you know you\u2019re close.\\n\\nThat\u2019s when I turned to the Play Console.\\n\\n## The Assumption I Didn\u2019t Question Enough\\n\\nIn my head, the flow was straightforward:\\n\\n1. Upload internal build\\n2. Do some testing myself\\n3. Move to closed testing\\n4. Release\\n\\nWhat I underestimated wasn\u2019t technical complexity\u2014it was **process friction**.\\n\\nGoogle Play now requires **a minimum of 12 testers for closed testing, active for 14 consecutive days**, before you\u2019re allowed to promote the app toward production.\\n\\nNot \u201crecommended.\u201d\\nNot \u201cif applicable.\u201d\\nRequired.\\n\\nI stared at that requirement longer than I\u2019d like to admit.\\n\\nTwelve testers.\\nFourteen days.\\nConsistent activity.\\n\\nI\u2019m a solo developer. This isn\u2019t a company app, a client project, or something with a built-in audience. It\u2019s a quiet utility. The kind of app people don\u2019t talk about\u2014but might use every morning.\\n\\nAnd suddenly, shipping wasn\u2019t about code quality or policy compliance. It was about **people**.\\n\\n## Where Solo Development Actually Hurts\\n\\nThere\u2019s a particular kind of frustration that only shows up at the end.\\n\\nNot when things are broken.\\nNot when you\u2019re debugging.\\nBut when the app is done\u2014and you\u2019re blocked anyway.\\n\\nI had followed the rules.\\nI had limited scope.\\nI had respected user privacy.\\nI had built something intentionally small and honest.\\n\\nAnd still, the final gate wasn\u2019t technical\u2014it was social.\\n\\n\u201cHow do solo devs even do this?\u201d became a real question, not a rhetorical one. You can\u2019t fake testers. You can\u2019t automate them. You can\u2019t replace them with discipline or skill.\\n\\nYou need humans who are willing to install an unfinished app and keep it installed for two weeks.\\n\\nThat requirement makes sense at scale. It protects users from broken apps. But at the solo level, it creates a quiet cliff that no tutorial warns you about.\\n\\n## Sitting With the Reality\\n\\nI won\u2019t pretend this didn\u2019t knock the wind out of me for a bit. There\u2019s a moment where you ask yourself whether the effort was worth it\u2014whether finishing the app just to stall at distribution counts as failure.\\n\\nI don\u2019t think it does -- or maybe _it does_.\\n\\nWhat I shipped matters more than whether it clears every gate immediately. I now have:\\n\\n- A complete app I understand end to end\\n- A release-ready codebase\\n- Real experience with Play Console\u2019s modern policies\\n- A sharper sense of where solo dev bottlenecks actually are\\n\\nThat\u2019s not nothing.\\n\\nIf anything, this experience forced a reframing: **shipping isn\u2019t a single act**. It\u2019s a sequence of different skills\u2014technical, procedural, and social. I had prepared well for two of them. I learned the third the hard way.\\n\\n## What I\u2019d Tell Another Solo Dev\\n\\nIf you\u2019re building alone and aiming for Google Play:\\n\\n- Plan for testers _early_, not at the end\\n- Assume policy gates are part of the product, not an afterthought\\n- Don\u2019t tie your self-worth to approval timelines\\n- Finishing the app is still a win\u2014even if distribution lags\\n\\nI\u2019m not giving up on this app per-se. But I\u2019m also not pretending the wall isn\u2019t there.\\n\\nThe code is done.\\nThe app works.\\nNow the challenge is different.\\n\\nAnd at least now, I know exactly where it is.\\n\\n## Choosing to Stop Chasing the Release\\n\\nAfter sitting with the 12-testers-for-14-days requirement for a while, I made a decision that surprised me by how calm it felt.\\n\\nI stopped trying to publish the app.\\n\\nNot because the app was broken.\\nNot because I lost interest in building it.\\nAnd not because the effort was wasted.\\n\\nI stopped because, at this point, the remaining work had nothing to do with software craftsmanship\u2014and everything to do with logistics I wasn\u2019t willing to force.\\n\\nFinding, coordinating, and managing a dozen testers for two weeks isn\u2019t hard in the abstract. But for a quiet, utility-style app with no marketing push and no audience, it turns into a different kind of project entirely. One I didn\u2019t sign up for, and one that would have pulled my energy away from the part I actually value: building thoughtful, constrained software.\\n\\nThat distinction mattered.\\n\\nSo instead of dragging the project through a phase I didn\u2019t believe in, I chose a cleaner ending.\\n\\n## Releasing the Work Without the Store\\n\\nRather than letting the app disappear into a private folder on my machine, I\u2019m making the **entire project public**.\\n\\nThe GitHub repository will be opened up, with:\\n\\n- The full source code\\n- The complete app architecture\\n- A **preview APK baked into the releases of the repo**, installable directly\\n- No Play Store listing, no tracking, no funnel\\n\\nIf you want to see the app, use it, inspect it, or learn from it\u2014you can. No gatekeeping, no waitlists, no accounts.\\n\\nHere is the link to the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/fluxaine-studios/proverb-daily.git), and here is the [installation APK from a local dev-machine preview build](https://github.com/fluxaine-studios/proverb-daily/releases).\\n\\nThis felt like the right compromise:\\nthe work exists, the app is usable, and the project is complete on _my_ terms.\\n\\nPublishing to an app store is one form of release.\\nOpen-sourcing a finished product is another.\\n\\n## What \u201cGiving Up\u201d Actually Means Here\\n\\nThere\u2019s a temptation to frame this kind of decision as failure. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s accurate.\\n\\nI didn\u2019t give up on building the app.\\nI gave up on forcing it through a channel that no longer made sense for its scale.\\n\\nThe app does exactly what it set out to do. It respects the user\u2019s time, works offline, collects nothing, and stays out of the way. Those values don\u2019t disappear just because there\u2019s no store badge next to the icon.\\n\\nIf anything, this experience clarified something important for me:\\n\\n> Shipping is not binary.\\n> You can finish something without commercializing it.\\n> You can release something without promoting it.\\n\\nAnd you can walk away without burning it down.\\n\\n## Closing the Loop\\n\\nThis project taught me more than a larger, messier app ever would have\u2014about constraints, discipline, and where solo developers actually hit friction in 2026.\\n\\nThe code is done.\\nThe app works.\\nThe repository will be public.\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s enough.\\n\\n---"},{"id":"blog-configuration","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/blog-configuration","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2026-01-23-blog-configuration.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-23-blog-configuration.md","title":"Setting up my Docusaurus Blog from the Boilerplate - Setup Part 4","description":"A mental model for structured, time-based publishing","date":"2026-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"docusaurus setup","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus-setup"},{"inline":true,"label":"blog section","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog-section"}],"readingTime":3.94,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Raghvendra Saralaya","title":"Software Engineer, Founder of Fluxain\u0113 Studios","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghavendra-saralaya/","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/227583517?v=4","key":"raghavendra","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"blog-configuration","title":"Setting up my Docusaurus Blog from the Boilerplate - Setup Part 4","authors":["raghavendra"],"tags":["docusaurus setup","blog section"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"I Built the App. Then the Play Store Built the Wall.","permalink":"/blog/brakes-on-proveb-daily"},"nextItem":{"title":"Refactoring Homepage Features from the Boilerplate - Setup Part 3","permalink":"/blog/homepage-features-refactor"}},"content":"_A mental model for structured, time-based publishing_\\n\\nWhen you first open a fresh Docusaurus project, the `/blog` folder can feel deceptively simple. A few Markdown files, maybe a folder or two, some YAML files \u2014 and yet a fully functional blog magically appears at `/blog`.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThis post explains **how the Docusaurus blogging system actually works**, what each file is responsible for, and how to think about blogs vs docs when building a serious content platform.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Big Picture: What the Docusaurus Blog Is\\n\\nDocusaurus ships with two core content systems:\\n\\n- **Docs** \u2192 structured, hierarchical, sidebar-driven knowledge\\n- **Blog** \u2192 flat, chronological, time-based publishing\\n\\nThe blog plugin is optimized for:\\n\\n- Announcements\\n- Studio updates\\n- Research notes\\n- Essays and long-form writing\\n- Dev logs and changelogs\\n\\nIf docs are your _knowledge base_, the blog is your _stream of thought over time_.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The `/blog` Folder Is the Entire Blog\\n\\nEverything under:\\n\\n```\\n/blog\\n```\\n\\nis managed by the Docusaurus blog plugin.\\n\\nThere is no registration step. No config per post. Docusaurus automatically:\\n\\n- Discovers blog posts\\n- Generates URLs\\n- Creates the blog index\\n- Builds tag and author pages\\n- Produces RSS feeds\\n\\nIf a file lives in `/blog`, Docusaurus treats it as publishable content.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Two Valid Blog Post Formats\\n\\nDocusaurus supports **two equally valid ways** to create a blog post.\\n\\n### 1. Flat File Posts\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nblog/\\n  2019-05-28-first-blog-post.md\\n```\\n\\nCharacteristics:\\n\\n- Filename usually starts with `YYYY-MM-DD`\\n- The date influences post ordering\\n- The filename becomes the URL slug (unless overridden)\\n\\nResulting URL:\\n\\n```\\n/blog/first-blog-post\\n```\\n\\nThis format is simple and works well for short posts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Folder-Based Posts (Recommended)\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nblog/\\n  2021-08-26-welcome/\\n    index.md\\n    banner.jpeg\\n```\\n\\nCharacteristics:\\n\\n- Folder represents a single post\\n- `index.md` or `index.mdx` is the entry point\\n- Assets live next to the content\\n\\nResulting URL:\\n\\n```\\n/blog/welcome\\n```\\n\\nThis format is ideal for:\\n\\n- Posts with images\\n- Research articles\\n- Long-form essays\\n- Studio or project updates\\n\\nFor most serious projects, **folder-based posts scale better**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Front Matter: The Control Panel of a Post\\n\\nEvery blog post begins with front matter:\\n\\n```md\\n---\\ntitle: Welcome to Fluxain\u0113 Studios\\nslug: welcome\\nauthors: [studio]\\ntags: [announcement, studio]\\ndraft: true\\n---\\n```\\n\\nCommon fields:\\n\\n| Field     | Purpose                       |\\n| --------- | ----------------------------- |\\n| `title`   | Display title                 |\\n| `slug`    | URL override                  |\\n| `date`    | Publish date                  |\\n| `authors` | Maps to `authors.yml`         |\\n| `tags`    | Freeform or predefined        |\\n| `draft`   | Excludes post from production |\\n\\nFront matter controls **how the post is published**, not just how it looks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Drafts, Previews, and Publishing\\n\\nDocusaurus has a built-in draft workflow.\\n\\nIf a post includes:\\n\\n```md\\ndraft: true\\n```\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n- It appears in local development\\n- It is excluded from production builds\\n- It does not appear in RSS feeds\\n- It is not indexed\\n\\nTo publish a post, simply remove the `draft` flag.\\n\\nThis gives you a clean:\\n**draft \u2192 preview \u2192 publish**\\nworkflow without a CMS.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Authors and Tags (Optional but Powerful)\\n\\n### `authors.yml`\\n\\nThis file defines reusable author profiles:\\n\\n```yml\\nstudio:\\n  name: Fluxain\u0113 Studios\\n  title: Research & Systems\\n```\\n\\nUsed in posts like:\\n\\n```md\\nauthors: [studio]\\n```\\n\\nDocusaurus automatically generates author pages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### `tags.yml`\\n\\nTags work even without this file, but `tags.yml` lets you add metadata:\\n\\n```yml\\nresearch:\\n  label: Research\\n  description: Exploratory and theoretical work\\n```\\n\\nEach tag automatically gets its own page:\\n\\n```\\n/blog/tags/research\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Markdown vs MDX\\n\\nYou\u2019ll notice both `.md` and `.mdx` files in the blog.\\n\\n- **`.md`** \u2192 pure writing, essays, notes\\n- **`.mdx`** \u2192 Markdown + React components\\n\\nUse MDX when you need:\\n\\n- Custom components\\n- Interactive examples\\n- Embedded diagrams or demos\\n\\nBoth formats coexist seamlessly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How Blog Routes Are Generated\\n\\nWithout any manual wiring, Docusaurus creates:\\n\\n| Page         | Route                    |\\n| ------------ | ------------------------ |\\n| Blog index   | `/blog`                  |\\n| Blog post    | `/blog/<slug>`           |\\n| Tag pages    | `/blog/tags/<tag>`       |\\n| Author pages | `/blog/authors/<author>` |\\n| RSS feed     | `/blog/rss.xml`          |\\n\\nEverything is derived from files and front matter.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Blogs Are Flat by Design\\n\\nUnlike docs:\\n\\n- Blog posts do not nest\\n- There is no sidebar hierarchy\\n- Ordering is purely chronological\\n\\nThis is intentional.\\n\\nIf content needs:\\n\\n- Structure\\n- Navigation\\n- Long-term discoverability\\n\\n\u2192 it belongs in **Docs**\\n\\nIf content represents:\\n\\n- Thought\\n- Progress\\n- Updates over time\\n\\n\u2192 it belongs in the **Blog**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What to Do With the Boilerplate Posts\\n\\nThe default blog posts exist to demonstrate:\\n\\n- Flat vs folder formats\\n- MD vs MDX\\n- Tags and authors\\n\\nYou can safely:\\n\\n- Delete them\\n- Rewrite them\\n- Replace them with studio-specific content\\n\\nNothing in the system depends on them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## A Recommended Blog Strategy\\n\\nFor a studio or research-driven site:\\n\\n- Prefer **folder-based posts**\\n- Keep posts as drafts until ready\\n- Use tags as _themes_, not categories\\n- Treat the blog as a thinking log\\n- Promote mature ideas into Docs later\\n\\nThis creates a clean pipeline from:\\n**exploration \u2192 articulation \u2192 canon**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Closing Thoughts\\n\\nDocusaurus blogging is deceptively simple on the surface, but extremely powerful once you understand the mental model:\\n\\n> Files become posts.\\n> Front matter becomes behavior.\\n> Time becomes structure.\\n\\nOnce that clicks, the blog system gets out of your way \u2014 and lets you focus on writing."},{"id":"homepage-features-refactor","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/homepage-features-refactor","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2026-01-22-homepage-features-refactor.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-22-homepage-features-refactor.md","title":"Refactoring

2","permalink":"/blog/multi-domain-content-architecture"}},"content":"While refining the Fluxain\u0113 Studios homepage, I made a small but important UI refactor: replacing the default SVG-based feature icons with custom 1080\xd71080 PNG images.\\n\\nAlthough this sounds simple, it touches **React component design**, **TypeScript module resolution**, and **Docusaurus asset handling**. This post walks through each change with a clear _before \u2192 after_ comparison.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why Change the Default SVG Setup?\\n\\nThe Docusaurus homepage template assumes:\\n\\n- Feature images are **SVGs**\\n- SVGs are imported as **React components**\\n- Styling is controlled via SVG props\\n\\nFor Fluxain\u0113 Studios, this wasn\u2019t ideal:\\n\\n- The visual identity required **high-resolution, circular PNG artwork**\\n- The images needed to behave like traditional media assets\\n- SVG-as-component semantics were no longer a good fit\\n\\nSo the goal became:\\n\\n> Replace SVG React components with standard PNG images \u2014 cleanly and type-safely.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Updating the Feature Data Model\\n\\n### Before: SVG as a React Component\\n\\n```tsx\\n// src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx\\n\\ntype FeatureItem = {\\n  title: string;\\n  Svg: React.ComponentType<React.ComponentProps<\\"svg\\">>;\\n  description: ReactNode;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nEach feature expected a renderable SVG component.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### After: Image Path Instead of Component\\n\\n```tsx\\n// src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx\\n\\ntype FeatureItem = {\\n  title: string;\\n  image: string;\\n  description: ReactNode;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis better reflects reality: PNGs are **assets**, not components.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Updating the Feature List\\n\\n### Before: SVG imports via `require`\\n\\n```tsx\\n// src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx\\n\\n{\\n  title: \\"Applied Research\\",\\n  Svg: require(\\"@site/static/img/research-feature-image.svg\\").default,\\n  description: (\\n    <>\\n      Extend or customize your website layout by reusing React.\\n    </>\\n  ),\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis pattern is specific to SVG loaders.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### After: PNG imports as modules\\n\\n```tsx\\n// src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx\\n\\nimport researchImg from \\"@site/static/img/research-feature-image.png\\";\\n\\n{\\n  title: \\"Applied Research\\",\\n  image: researchImg,\\n  description: (\\n    <>\\n      Extend or customize your website layout by reusing React.\\n    </>\\n  ),\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHere, the feature images were placed into `static/img/` directory.\\n\\n```bash\\nstatic/img/culture-feature-image.png\\nstatic/img/research-feature-image.png\\nstatic/img/tech-feature-image.png\\n```\\n\\nThis approach is:\\n\\n- More explicit\\n- Type-safe\\n- Easier to refactor later\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Updating the Feature Component\\n\\n### Before: Rendering an SVG Component\\n\\n```tsx\\n// src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx\\n\\nfunction Feature({ title, Svg, description }: FeatureItem) {\\n  return (\\n    <div className={clsx(\\"col col--4\\")}>\\n      <div className=\\"text--center\\">\\n        <Svg className={styles.featureSvg} role=\\"img\\" />\\n      </div>\\n      <div className=\\"text--center padding-horiz--md\\">\\n        <Heading as=\\"h3\\">{title}</Heading>\\n        <p>{description}</p>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe component assumed SVG-specific behavior.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### After: Rendering a Standard Image\\n\\n```tsx\\n// src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx\\n\\nfunction Feature({ title, image, description }: FeatureItem) {\\n  return (\\n    <div className={clsx(\\"col col--4\\")}>\\n      <div className=\\"text--center\\">\\n        <img\\n          src={image}\\n          alt={title}\\n          className={styles.featureImage}\\n          loading=\\"lazy\\"\\n        />\\n      </div>\\n      <div className=\\"text--center padding-horiz--md\\">\\n        <Heading as=\\"h3\\">{title}</Heading>\\n        <p>{description}</p>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis aligns with standard HTML semantics and improves accessibility.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Handling TypeScript PNG Import Errors\\n\\nAfter switching to PNG imports, TypeScript raised the following error:\\n\\n```\\nCannot find module \'*.png\' or its corresponding type declarations\\n```\\n\\nThis happens because **TypeScript does not understand non-code assets by default**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Fix: Declare Image Modules\\n\\nA global declaration file was added:\\n\\n```ts\\n// src/types/images.d.ts\\n\\ndeclare module \\"*.png\\" {\\n  const src: string;\\n  export default src;\\n}\\n\\ndeclare module \\"*.jpg\\" {\\n  const src: string;\\n  export default src;\\n}\\n\\ndeclare module \\"*.jpeg\\" {\\n  const src: string;\\n  export default src;\\n}\\n\\ndeclare module \\"*.webp\\" {\\n  const src: string;\\n  export default src;\\n}\\n\\ndeclare module \\"*.svg\\" {\\n  const src: string;\\n  export default src;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWith this in place, TypeScript correctly understands image imports across the project.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Styling High-Resolution Images Responsibly\\n\\nEven though the source images are **1080\xd71080**, they should never render at that size.\\n\\nInstead, CSS controls display size:\\n\\n```css\\n/* src/components/HomepageFeatures/styles.module.css */\\n\\n.featureImage {\\n  width: 250px;\\n  height: auto;\\n  margin: 1rem;\\n  border-radius: 50%; /* circular feature image */\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis preserves:\\n\\n- Sharpness on retina displays\\n- Layout consistency\\n- Performance\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Final Result\\n\\nAfter these changes, the homepage feature section:\\n\\n- Uses **custom, high-resolution PNG artwork**\\n- Avoids SVG-specific assumptions\\n- Remains fully type-safe\\n- Is easier to theme, animate, and extend\\n\\nMost importantly, the code now reflects the **design intent** of the site rather than the defaults of the template.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Closing Thoughts\\n\\nThis refactor is a good reminder that:\\n\\n> Boilerplate is a starting point \u2014 not a constraint.\\n\\nSmall structural changes like this compound over time and make future design and content decisions significantly easier."},{"id":"multi-domain-content-architecture","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/multi-domain-content-architecture","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2026-01-15-multi-domain-content-architecture.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-15-multi-domain-content-architecture.md","title":"Multi-domain Content Architecture with Docusaurus - Setup Part 2","description":"From monolithic docs to structured knowledge domains","date":"2026-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"docusaurus setup","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus-setup"},{"inline":true,"label":"multi-domain content","permalink":"/blog/tags/multi-domain-content"}],"readingTime":6.45,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Raghvendra Saralaya","title":"Software Engineer, Founder of Fluxain\u0113 Studios","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghavendra-saralaya/","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/227583517?v=4","key":"raghavendra","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"multi-domain-content-architecture","title":"Multi-domain Content Architecture with Docusaurus - Setup Part 2","authors":["raghavendra"],"tags":["docusaurus setup","multi-domain content"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Refactoring Homepage Features from the Boilerplate - Setup Part 3","permalink":"/blog/homepage-features-refactor"},"nextItem":{"title":"From Zero to Live - Setup Part 1","permalink":"/blog/zero-to-live-post"}},"content":"_From monolithic docs to structured knowledge domains_\\n\\nMost documentation systems start simple\u2014and then quietly become a mess.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWhat begins as \u201cjust write some docs\u201d turns into:\\n\\n- unrelated topics sharing a sidebar\\n- navigation that feels accidental\\n- folders that encode structure but not meaning\\n- readers getting lost because _everything is technically connected, but nothing is conceptually separated_\\n\\nThis post documents how I rebuilt the documentation architecture for **Fluxain\u0113 Studios** using **Docusaurus**, moving from a single, monolithic docs setup to a **multi-domain, sidebar-isolated knowledge system** that scales cleanly.\\n\\nNo hacks. No plugins beyond what Docusaurus already provides. Just intentional structure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Problem with the Default Docs Setup\\n\\nOut of the box, Docusaurus gives you:\\n\\n- one `docs/` folder\\n- one sidebar\\n- one cognitive space\\n\\nThat\u2019s fine for a tutorial or a product manual.\\n\\nIt breaks down when you want to host **multiple independent domains of knowledge**, such as:\\n\\n- somatic theory\\n- anthropology\\n- software architecture\\n- trading systems\\n- recipes\\n\\nWhen everything shares one sidebar, you get _navigation spillover_: topics that should never coexist suddenly feel related simply because they sit next to each other.\\n\\nThe core issue is not content\u2014it\u2019s **architecture**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Design Goal\\n\\nThe goal was simple to state, but nontrivial to implement:\\n\\n- Each domain should feel like its **own body of work**\\n- Each domain should have:\\n  - its own URL namespace\\n  - its own sidebar\\n  - zero awareness of other domains\\n- There should still be a single entry point that shows _what exists_\\n\\nIn other words:\\n\\n**one studio, many books.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 1: Disable the Monolithic Docs Preset\\n\\nThe key realization is that the Docusaurus \u201cclassic\u201d preset creates **one docs instance by default**.\\n\\nThat\u2019s the source of sidebar spillover.\\n\\nSo the first step was to explicitly disable it:\\n\\n```tsx\\n// docusaurus.config.ts\\n\\n...\\npresets: [\\n  [\\n    \'classic\',\\n    {\\n      docs: false, // set this to false to turn off the default monolithic docs\\n      blog: { /* unchanged */ },\\n      ...\\n    },\\n  ],\\n],\\n...\\n```\\n\\nThis removes the implicit \u201ceverything lives in one docs universe\u201d assumption.\\n\\nFrom here on, **every docs space is created intentionally**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 2: Create a `/docs` Landing Page (Without a Sidebar)\\n\\nInstead of `/docs` being \u201cthe docs,\u201d it becomes an **index of domains**.\\n\\nA small, dedicated docs instance is created solely for this purpose:\\n\\n```tsx\\n// docusaurus.config.ts\\n\\n...\\nplugins: [\\n    [\\n      \\"@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs\\",\\n      {\\n        id: \\"landing\\",\\n        path: \\"docs/landing\\",\\n        routeBasePath: \\"docs\\",\\n        sidebarPath: false,\\n      },\\n    ],\\n]\\n...\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe result:\\n\\n- `/docs` exists\\n- it has no sidebar\\n- it cannot accidentally grow into a content dump\\n\\nThis page answers one question only:\\n\\n_What bodies of knowledge exist here?_\\n\\nIn the `docs/landing/` folder in the project repo, create a file called `index.md`. This is where docs leads to now.\\n\\n```md\\n\x3c!-- docs/landing/index.md --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\nid: index\\ntitle: Fluxain\u0113 Studios Corpora\\nslug: /\\nsidebar_position: 1\\n\\n---\\n\\nWelcome to the canonical knowledge base of Fluxain\u0113 Studios.\\n\\nEach domain below is an independent body of research and practice.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Domains\\n\\n### \ud83e\udde0 Somatic Theory\\n\\nEmbodiment, nervous systems, and lived practice.  \\n\u2192 [/somatic-theory/](/somatic-theory/)\\n\\n### \ud83e\uddec Anthropology\\n\\nField notes, theory, ethnography.  \\n\u2192 [/anthropology/](/anthropology/)\\n\\n### \ud83e\udd16 Android\\n\\nArchitecture, systems, and case studies.  \\n\u2192 [/android/](/android/)\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcc8 Rust Trading\\n\\nQuant models, backtesting, market structure.  \\n\u2192 [/rust-trading/](/rust-trading/)\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf73 Recipes\\n\\nTechniques, experiments, and dishes.  \\n\u2192 [/recipes/](/recipes/)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 3: Create the First Domain (The Reference Pattern)\\n\\nEach domain is implemented as its **own docs plugin instance**.\\n\\nFor example, let\'s consider the domain _Somatic Theory_:\\n\\n```plaintext\\ndocs/somatic-theory/\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 intro.md\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe root document defines the domain entry point, i.e. the landing page for _Somatic Theory_ domain:\\n\\n```markdown\\n\x3c!-- docs/somatic-theory/intro.md --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\ntitle: Somatic Theory\\nslug: /\\n\\n---\\n```\\n\\nThis maps cleanly to:\\n\\n```\\ndocs/somatic-theory\\n\\n```\\n\\nA dedicated sidebar is defined using autogenerated structure:\\n\\n```tsx\\n// docusaurus.config.ts\\n\\n...\\n\\n// manually added plugins\\nplugins: [\\n  [\\n    \\"@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs\\",\\n    {\\n      id: \\"landing\\",\\n      path: \\"docs/landing\\",\\n      routeBasePath: \\"docs\\",\\n      sidebarPath: false,\\n    },\\n  ],\\n  [\\n    \\"@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs\\",\\n    {\\n      id: \\"somatic-theory\\",\\n      path: \\"docs/somatic-theory\\",\\n      routeBasePath: \\"somatic-theory\\",\\n      sidebarPath: require.resolve(\\"./sidebars/somatic-theory.ts\\"),\\n    },\\n  ],\\n]\\n\\n...\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\nThen, create the sidebar component.\\n\\n```ts\\n// sidebars/somatic-theory.ts\\n\\nimport type { SidebarsConfig } from \\"@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs\\";\\n\\nconst sidebars: SidebarsConfig = {\\n  somaticTheorySidebar: [\\n    {\\n      type: \\"autogenerated\\",\\n      dirName: \\".\\",\\n    },\\n  ],\\n};\\n\\nexport default sidebars;\\n```\\n\\nAt this point, the pattern is established:\\n\\n- one domain\\n- one sidebar\\n- one URL space\\n- no coupling\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 4: Add Additional Domains (Mechanical, Repeatable)\\n\\nOnce the pattern exists, adding new domains is purely mechanical. For instance, add domains such as:\\n\\n- Anthropology\\n- Android\\n- Rust Trading\\n- Recipes\\n\\nEach one:\\n\\n- lives in its own folder\\n- has its own docs plugin\\n- has its own sidebar file\\n- maps to its own route\\n\\nThis is where the architecture starts paying dividends:\\n\\nadding domains does not increase complexity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 5: Use Folders for Structure, `_category_.json` for Meaning\\n\\nInside each domain, **folders define hierarchy**, but `_category_.json` defines _intent_.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```json\\n// docs/somatic-theory/seven-portal-systems/_category_.json\\n{\\n  \\"label\\": \\"Seven-Portal Systems\\",\\n  \\"collapsed\\": false,\\n  \\"position\\": 1\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis small file controls:\\n\\n- sidebar labels\\n- ordering\\n- default expansion state\\n\\nThe important mental model is this:\\n\\n> Folders define structure.\\n>\\n> `_category_.json` defines meaning.\\n\\n- The filesystem answers _where_.\\n- The category file answers _what_.\\n\\nThe file system inside the domain looks something like this:\\n\\n```plaintext\\n\\ndocs/somatic-theory/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 intro.md\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 seven-portal-systems\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 _category_.json\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 diagnostic-patterns.md\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 overview.md\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 seven-portals.md\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 shadow-mechanics\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 _category_.json\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 diagnostic-patterns.md\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 overview.md\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 seven-portals.md\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 the-flow-of-now (sub-category)\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 _category_.json\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 diagnostic-patterns.md\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 overview.md\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 seven-portals.md (leaf document)\\n```\\n\\nAt the ends of the hierarchy live **leaf documents**:\\n\\n- exercises\\n- recipes\\n- techniques\\n- references\\n\\nThese carry **no structural responsibility**.\\n\\nThey only describe themselves via front matter.\\n\\nA canonical leaf document looks like this:\\n\\n```yaml\\n---\\ntitle: Presence Exercises\\ndescription: Practical somatic exercises for cultivating present-moment awareness.\\ntags:\\n  - practice\\n  - somatic\\ndraft: false\\nhide_table_of_contents: false\\n---\\n```\\n\\n#### Leaf-document at the sub-category level\\n\\nThe leaf-document can sit at the level of the sub-category directly, but will compete with the sidebar positioning of the sub-categories in the domain.\\n\\nFor instance, `sidebar_position: 2` in the front matter of the sub-category-level leaf-node will have to work with the `_category_.json`\'s `\\"position\\": 4` field for the ordering to be set correctly.\\n\\n#### Ordering of the leaf-documents\\n\\nWithin the sub-category, the leaf documents can be ordered as needed by using `sidebar_position: 1` in the front matter of the leaf-document markdown.\\n\\n```markdown\\n---\\ntitle: Overview\\nsidebar_position: 1\\n---\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 6: Clean Up Defaults\\n\\nWith the architecture in place, all tutorial artifacts were removed:\\n\\n- default tutorial folders\\n- unused `sidebars.ts`\\n- legacy docs assumptions\\n\\nWhat remained was only what was explicitly referenced.\\n\\nThis matters more than it sounds:\\n\\n> _**ambiguity is technical debt**._\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 7: Make the Navbar Reflect Reality\\n\\nFinally, the navbar was made explicit:\\n\\n```ts\\n// docusaurus.config.ts\\n\\n...\\n\\nthemeConfig: {\\n  ...\\n  navbar: {\\n    title: \\"Fluxain\u0113 Studios\\",\\n    logo: {\\n      alt: \\"Fluxain\u0113 Studios\' Logo\\",\\n      src: \\"img/logo.png\\",\\n    },\\n    items: [\\n      {\\n        to: \\"/somatic-theory/\\",\\n        label: \\"Somatic Theory\\",\\n        position: \\"left\\",\\n      },\\n      {\\n        to: \\"/anthropology/\\",\\n        label: \\"Anthropology\\",\\n        position: \\"left\\",\\n      },\\n      {\\n        to: \\"/android/\\",\\n        label: \\"Android\\",\\n        position: \\"left\\",\\n      },\\n      {\\n        to: \\"/rust-trading/\\",\\n        label: \\"Rust Trading\\",\\n        position: \\"left\\",\\n      },\\n      {\\n        to: \\"/recipes/\\",\\n        label: \\"Recipes\\",\\n        position: \\"left\\",\\n      },\\n      { to: \\"/blog\\", label: \\"Blog\\", position: \\"right\\" },\\n      // { to: \\"/contact\\", label: \\"Contact\\", position: \\"right\\" },\\n    ],\\n  ...\\n  }\\n...\\n\\n```\\n\\nNo dynamic logic was needed.\\n\\nBecause the URLs are honest, Docusaurus automatically highlights the active domain.\\n\\nThe system is _domain-aware by construction_.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 8: Adding the Footer\\n\\nIn the `docusaurus.config.ts` file, make the following changes and modify when appropriate.\\n\\n```ts\\n// docusaurus.config.ts\\n\\n...\\nthemeConfig: {\\n  ...\\n      footer: {\\n      style: \\"dark\\",\\n      links: [\\n        {\\n          title: \\"Publishing\\",\\n          items: [\\n            { label: \\"Substack\\", href: \\"https://substack.com\\" },\\n            { label: \\"Gumroad\\", href: \\"https://gumroad.com\\" },\\n          ],\\n        },\\n        {\\n          title: \\"Support\\",\\n          items: [\\n            { label: \\"Ko-fi\\", href: \\"#\\" },\\n            { label: \\"Buy Me a Coffee\\", href: \\"#\\" },\\n          ],\\n        },\\n        {\\n          title: \\"More\\",\\n          items: [\\n            {\\n              label: \\"Blog\\",\\n              to: \\"/blog\\",\\n            }\\n          ],\\n        },\\n      ],\\n      copyright: `Copyright \xa9 ${new Date().getFullYear()} Raghavendra Saralaya.

Create the GitHub Pages repository\\n\\nCreate a repository named:\\n\\n```\\nfluxaine-studios.github.io\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis naming convention enables **GitHub Pages organization root hosting**, meaning the site will live directly at:\\n\\n```\\nhttps://fluxaine-studios.github.io\\n\\n```\\n\\nClone the repository locally.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phase 2 \u2014 Scaffold Docusaurus (TypeScript)\\n\\n### 2. Generate the Docusaurus site\\n\\nFrom inside the repository directory:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-docusaurus@latest website classic --typescript\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis scaffolds a full Docusaurus project using:\\n\\n- the **classic preset**\\n- **TypeScript**\\n- modern defaults\\n\\nAt this stage, the site lives in a `website/` subdirectory.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Move Docusaurus to the repository root\\n\\nTo keep the repository clean and conventional, move the scaffolded files up one level:\\n\\n```bash\\nmv website/* website/.* . 2>/dev/null\\nrmdir website\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe repository root now contains:\\n\\n```\\ndocusaurus.config.ts\\npackage.json\\nsrc/\\nstatic/\\nsidebars.ts\\n\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Verify local development\\n\\nInstall dependencies and start the dev server:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install\\nnpm run start\\n\\n```\\n\\nConfirm the site runs locally at:\\n\\n```\\nhttp://localhost:3000\\n\\n```\\n\\nAt this point, the local development environment is fully functional.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phase 3 \u2014 Configure Site Metadata\\n\\n### 5. Update Docusaurus configuration\\n\\nEdit `docusaurus.config.ts` to reflect the real site identity:\\n\\n```tsx\\ntitle: \'Fluxain\u0113 Studios\',\\nurl: \'https://fluxaine-studios.github.io\',\\nbaseUrl: \'/\',\\norganizationName: \'fluxaine-studios\',\\nprojectName: \'fluxaine-studios.github.io\',\\ndeploymentBranch: \'gh-pages\',\\n\\n```\\n\\nBecause this is an **organization root site**, `baseUrl` remains `/`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6. Commit the baseline\\n\\nThis is the first stable checkpoint:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit add .\\ngit commit -m \\"chore: initial Docusaurus site scaffold (TypeScript)\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phase 4 \u2014 GitHub Actions Deployment\\n\\nTo deploy automatically on every push to `main`, a GitHub Actions workflow is added.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 7. Create the deployment workflow\\n\\nCreate:\\n\\n```\\n.github/workflows/deploy.yml\\n\\n```\\n\\n```yaml\\nname: Deploy to GitHub Pages\\n\\non:\\n  push:\\n    branches:\\n      - main\\n\\njobs:\\n  deploy:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    permissions:\\n      contents: write\\n\\n    steps:\\n      - name: Checkout\\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\\n\\n      - name: Setup Node\\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\\n        with:\\n          node-version: 20\\n          cache: npm\\n\\n      - name: Install dependencies\\n        run: npm ci\\n\\n      - name: Build website\\n        run: npm run build\\n\\n      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages\\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4\\n        with:\\n          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\\n          publish_dir: ./build\\n```\\n\\nKey decisions:\\n\\n- **Node 20** is used to meet modern Docusaurus requirements\\n- Deployment targets the `gh-pages` branch\\n- No manual secrets are required\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 8.
