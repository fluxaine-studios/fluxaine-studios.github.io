# Building a Multi-Domain Documentation System with Docusaurus

_From monolithic docs to structured knowledge domains_

Most documentation systems start simple—and then quietly become a mess.

<!-- truncate -->

What begins as “just write some docs” turns into:

- unrelated topics sharing a sidebar
- navigation that feels accidental
- folders that encode structure but not meaning
- readers getting lost because _everything is technically connected, but nothing is conceptually separated_

This post documents how I rebuilt the documentation architecture for **Fluxainē Studios** using **Docusaurus**, moving from a single, monolithic docs setup to a **multi-domain, sidebar-isolated knowledge system** that scales cleanly.

No hacks. No plugins beyond what Docusaurus already provides. Just intentional structure.

---

## The Problem with the Default Docs Setup

Out of the box, Docusaurus gives you:

- one `docs/` folder
- one sidebar
- one cognitive space

That’s fine for a tutorial or a product manual.

It breaks down when you want to host **multiple independent domains of knowledge**, such as:

- somatic theory
- anthropology
- software architecture
- trading systems
- recipes

When everything shares one sidebar, you get _navigation spillover_: topics that should never coexist suddenly feel related simply because they sit next to each other.

The core issue is not content—it’s **architecture**.

---

## The Design Goal

The goal was simple to state, but nontrivial to implement:

- Each domain should feel like its **own body of work**
- Each domain should have:
  - its own URL namespace
  - its own sidebar
  - zero awareness of other domains
- There should still be a single entry point that shows _what exists_

In other words:

**one studio, many books.**

---

## Step 1: Disable the Monolithic Docs Preset

The key realization is that the Docusaurus “classic” preset creates **one docs instance by default**.

That’s the source of sidebar spillover.

So the first step was to explicitly disable it:

```tsx
// docusaurus.config.ts

...
presets: [
  [
    'classic',
    {
      docs: false, // set this to false to turn off the default monolithic docs
      blog: { /* unchanged */ },
      ...
    },
  ],
],
...
```

This removes the implicit “everything lives in one docs universe” assumption.

From here on, **every docs space is created intentionally**.

---

## Step 2: Create a `/docs` Landing Page (Without a Sidebar)

Instead of `/docs` being “the docs,” it becomes an **index of domains**.

A small, dedicated docs instance is created solely for this purpose:

```tsx
// docusaurus.config.ts

...
plugins: [
    [
      "@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs",
      {
        id: "landing",
        path: "docs/landing",
        routeBasePath: "docs",
        sidebarPath: false,
      },
    ],
]
...

```

The result:

- `/docs` exists
- it has no sidebar
- it cannot accidentally grow into a content dump

This page answers one question only:

_What bodies of knowledge exist here?_

In the `docs/landing/` folder in the project repo, create a file called `index.md`. This is where docs leads to now.

```md
<!-- docs/landing/index.md -->

---

id: index
title: Fluxainē Studios Corpora
slug: /
sidebar_position: 1

---

Welcome to the canonical knowledge base of Fluxainē Studios.

Each domain below is an independent body of research and practice.

---

## Domains

### 🧠 Somatic Theory

Embodiment, nervous systems, and lived practice.  
→ [/somatic-theory/](/somatic-theory/)

### 🧬 Anthropology

Field notes, theory, ethnography.  
→ [/anthropology/](/anthropology/)

### 🤖 Android

Architecture, systems, and case studies.  
→ [/android/](/android/)

### 📈 Rust Trading

Quant models, backtesting, market structure.  
→ [/rust-trading/](/rust-trading/)

### 🍳 Recipes

Techniques, experiments, and dishes.  
→ [/recipes/](/recipes/)
```

---

## Step 3: Create the First Domain (The Reference Pattern)

Each domain is implemented as its **own docs plugin instance**.

For example, let's consider the domain _Somatic Theory_:

```plaintext
docs/somatic-theory/
└── intro.md


```

The root document defines the domain entry point, i.e. the landing page for _Somatic Theory_ domain:

```markdown
<!-- docs/somatic-theory/intro.md -->

---

title: Somatic Theory
slug: /

---
```

This maps cleanly to:

```
docs/somatic-theory

```

A dedicated sidebar is defined using autogenerated structure:

```tsx
// docusaurus.config.ts

...

// manually added plugins
plugins: [
  [
    "@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs",
    {
      id: "landing",
      path: "docs/landing",
      routeBasePath: "docs",
      sidebarPath: false,
    },
  ],
  [
    "@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs",
    {
      id: "somatic-theory",
      path: "docs/somatic-theory",
      routeBasePath: "somatic-theory",
      sidebarPath: require.resolve("./sidebars/somatic-theory.ts"),
    },
  ],
]

...


```

Then, create the sidebar component.

```ts
// sidebars/somatic-theory.ts

import type { SidebarsConfig } from "@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs";

const sidebars: SidebarsConfig = {
  somaticTheorySidebar: [
    {
      type: "autogenerated",
      dirName: ".",
    },
  ],
};

export default sidebars;
```

At this point, the pattern is established:

- one domain
- one sidebar
- one URL space
- no coupling

---

## Step 4: Add Additional Domains (Mechanical, Repeatable)

Once the pattern exists, adding new domains is purely mechanical. For instance, add domains such as:

- Anthropology
- Android
- Rust Trading
- Recipes

Each one:

- lives in its own folder
- has its own docs plugin
- has its own sidebar file
- maps to its own route

This is where the architecture starts paying dividends:

adding domains does not increase complexity.

---

## Step 5: Use Folders for Structure, `_category_.json` for Meaning

Inside each domain, **folders define hierarchy**, but `_category_.json` defines _intent_.

Example:

```json
// docs/somatic-theory/seven-portal-systems/_category_.json
{
  "label": "Seven-Portal Systems",
  "collapsed": false,
  "position": 1
}
```

This small file controls:

- sidebar labels
- ordering
- default expansion state

The important mental model is this:

> Folders define structure.
>
> `_category_.json` defines meaning.

- The filesystem answers _where_.
- The category file answers _what_.

The file system inside the domain looks something like this:

```plaintext

docs/somatic-theory/
├── intro.md
├── seven-portal-systems
│   ├── _category_.json
│   ├── diagnostic-patterns.md
│   ├── overview.md
│   └── seven-portals.md
├── shadow-mechanics
│   ├── _category_.json
│   ├── diagnostic-patterns.md
│   ├── overview.md
│   └── seven-portals.md
└── the-flow-of-now (sub-category)
    ├── _category_.json
    ├── diagnostic-patterns.md
    ├── overview.md
    └── seven-portals.md (leaf document)
```

At the ends of the hierarchy live **leaf documents**:

- exercises
- recipes
- techniques
- references

These carry **no structural responsibility**.

They only describe themselves via front matter.

A canonical leaf document looks like this:

```yaml
---
title: Presence Exercises
description: Practical somatic exercises for cultivating present-moment awareness.
tags:
  - practice
  - somatic
draft: false
hide_table_of_contents: false
---
```

#### Leaf-document at the sub-category level

The leaf-document can sit at the level of the sub-category directly, but will compete with the sidebar positioning of the sub-categories in the domain.

For instance, `sidebar_position: 2` in the front matter of the sub-category-level leaf-node will have to work with the `_category_.json`'s `"position": 4` field for the ordering to be set correctly.

#### Ordering of the leaf-documents

Within the sub-category, the leaf documents can be ordered as needed by using `sidebar_position: 1` in the front matter of the leaf-document markdown.

```markdown
---
title: Overview
sidebar_position: 1
---
```

---

## Step 6: Clean Up Defaults

With the architecture in place, all tutorial artifacts were removed:

- default tutorial folders
- unused `sidebars.ts`
- legacy docs assumptions

What remained was only what was explicitly referenced.

This matters more than it sounds:

> _**ambiguity is technical debt**._

---

## Step 7: Make the Navbar Reflect Reality

Finally, the navbar was made explicit:

```ts
// docusaurus.config.ts

...

themeConfig: {
  ...
  navbar: {
    title: "Fluxainē Studios",
    logo: {
      alt: "Fluxainē Studios' Logo",
      src: "img/logo.png",
    },
    items: [
      {
        to: "/somatic-theory/",
        label: "Somatic Theory",
        position: "left",
      },
      {
        to: "/anthropology/",
        label: "Anthropology",
        position: "left",
      },
      {
        to: "/android/",
        label: "Android",
        position: "left",
      },
      {
        to: "/rust-trading/",
        label: "Rust Trading",
        position: "left",
      },
      {
        to: "/recipes/",
        label: "Recipes",
        position: "left",
      },
      { to: "/blog", label: "Blog", position: "right" },
      // { to: "/contact", label: "Contact", position: "right" },
    ],
  ...
  }
...

```

No dynamic logic was needed.

Because the URLs are honest, Docusaurus automatically highlights the active domain.

The system is _domain-aware by construction_.

---

## The Final Result

The end state is a documentation system that:

- treats domains as first-class entities
- prevents sidebar spillover by design
- scales horizontally without refactors
- separates structure from content
- supports both narrative and reference material
- is ready for CMS integration if needed

Most importantly, it feels calm.

Readers are never asked to mentally reconcile unrelated topics just because they share navigation.

---

## Closing Thought

The biggest shift wasn’t technical—it was conceptual:

> Documentation isn’t a folder tree.
>
> It’s a map of ideas.

Once the architecture reflects that, the tooling falls into place naturally.
